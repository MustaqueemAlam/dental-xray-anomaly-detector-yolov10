# ü¶∑ AI Dental Anomaly Detector

This is a **web-based application** that uses a **YOLOv10 machine learning model** to detect potential anomalies in **dental panoramic X-ray images**.

The application provides a simple, user-friendly interface for uploading an image and viewing the **AI-analyzed results** with bounding boxes drawn around detected issues.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Leverages a fine-tuned YOLOv10 model to identify dental anomalies
- **Supported Detections**: Trained to detect **Cavity, Filling, Implant, and Impacted Teeth**
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive, and easy-to-use interface built with **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**
- **Backend Server**: Lightweight **Node.js + Express** server for image uploads and processing
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Displays the **original** and **processed** images for clear analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Python, PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv10, OpenCV
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, SweetAlert2

## üìÇ Dataset

This project was trained on the **Dental Radiography for Anomaly Detection** dataset available on Kaggle.

üîó [Dental Radiography on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/dental-radiography)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js (with npm)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### üîß Setup & Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MustaqueemAlam/dental-detector-app.git
cd dental-detector-app
```

#### Step 2: Add Model Files

Place your trained model files into the model_files directory:

```plaintext
dental_yolov10_best.pt
class_mapping.pkl
```

The final structure should look like this:

```plaintext
/dental-detector-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ model_files/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dental_yolov10_best.pt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ class_mapping.pkl
...
```

#### Step 3: Set Up the Python Environment

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r python_inference/requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Set Up the Node.js Server

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. Ensure the Python virtual environment is active
2. Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### How to Use

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Upload a dental panoramic X-ray image
3. Click "Diagnose Image"
4. View results showing original and processed images with detected anomalies

Step 2: Add Model Files

Place your trained model files into the model_files directory:

dental_yolov10_best.pt

class_mapping.pkl

The final structure should look like this:

/dental-detector-app/
|-- üìÇ model_files/
|   |-- dental_yolov10_best.pt
|   |-- class_mapping.pkl
...

Step 3: Set Up the Python Environment

It is crucial to create a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies and avoid conflicts.

Create the virtual environment (this creates a venv folder in your project):

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

After activation, your terminal prompt should start with (venv).

Install Python dependencies:
With the environment active, install all required libraries from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r python_inference/requirements.txt

Step 4: Set Up the Node.js Server

Install Node.js dependencies:
In the project's root directory (where package.json is located), run:

npm install

This will download all necessary packages (like Express) and create a node_modules folder.

Running the Application
Ensure the Python virtual environment is active. If you've opened a new terminal, you must activate it again (.\venv\Scripts\activate).

Start the server from the project's root directory:

node server.js

You should see the following message in your terminal:

Server is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can now use the application.

How to Use
Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Drag and drop a dental panoramic X-ray image onto the upload area, or click to select a file from your computer.

Click the "Diagnose Image" button.

A loading pop-up will appear while the model processes the image.

The results will be displayed, showing your original image alongside the image with detected anomalies highlighted by bounding boxes.

Click "Analyze Another Image" to reset and upload a new file.
